                        Some of the reasons that we may take such actions include, but aren’t necessarily limited to, the following: (i) if we have reason to believe (at our sole discretion) that information provided by a Campaign Organiser is false, 
                        misleading, or fraudulent, or that funds are being used in a prohibited manner; (ii) if the funds available (as determined by Kolabo at its sole discretion) should be provided directly to a person other than the Campaign Organiser
                         (such as a legal beneficiary or person entitled by law to act on behalf of a Campaign Organiser); (iii) if we have reason to believe that a Campaign or Campaign Organiser has violated these Terms of Service; 
                         (iv) if Kolabo determines that the Campaign Organiser is colluding with donors to engage in fraudulent activity; (v) if we have reason to believe (at our sole discretion) that there may be suspicious or fraudulent donation activity; 
                         or (vi) if required in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, writ, injunction, or as otherwise required under applicable laws and regulations. If you have questions about a Hold we may have placed on your Campaign account,
